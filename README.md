# LAB-QA2GO
LAB–QA2GO  - A free, easy-to-use toolbox for the  quality assessment of magnetic resonance imaging data

LAB–QA2GO is a light-weighted virtual machine which provides scripts for fully automated QA analyses of phantom and human datasets. This virtual machine is ready for analysis by starting it the first time. With minimal configuration in the guided web-interface the first analysis can start within 10 minutes, while adapting to local phantoms and needs is easily possible.

# Download
The LAB–QA2GO tool is a virtual machine based on [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "Official Virtual Box Site"). The image can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/cqfpx/download "LAB-QA2GO download page on OSF"). After downloading the tool, you have to integrate the virtual machine into your Virtual Box client.

# Versions
## current version
The current version is 0.7.

# Feedback
This is the first version of this tool. It is adapted to the data of our MRI lab at the University of Marburg. If you got a problem or questions just contact me, so that I can help you.

# License
LAB-QA2GO is licensed under the BSD license for phantom data analysis.

For human data analysis [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Licence "FSL Licence") routines are used in the current version. It is therefore not allowed to use LAB-QA2GO in commercial setup, when you are interested in human data analysis.

Furthermore LAB-QA2GO is not intended as a clinical tool. It does not replace maintenance by a trained / skilled professional.
